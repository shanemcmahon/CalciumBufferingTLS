CalciumBufferingTLS
===================

Source code to fit calcium buffering data to a 1-3 buffer saturable buffer model using total least squares

Source code to accompany the paper "In Situ Ca2+ Titration in the Fluorometric Study of Intracellular Ca2+ Binding"

Includes a library for total least squares regression on arbitrary models using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and an interface for performing the regression on a calcium buffering model.
